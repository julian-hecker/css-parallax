## Why this package?

Parallax is a popular UX feature that is typically implemented with JavaScript, using costly window.onscroll event listeners and callbacks functions running hundreds of per scroll.

Implementing Parallax using the CSS 3D Transform properties makes it possible to implement parallax without consuming as many computational resources as a JavaScript implementation.
